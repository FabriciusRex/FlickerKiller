# FlickerKiller

Created using winforms on Visual Studio 2017.

Purpose: To prevent Surface Pro 4 screen flicker. I noticed that the flicker would stop if a pixel was animated.
So, therefor I created this simple app that opens a winform window and fades it in and out by changing its opacity.

Usage:
Import git repo to Visual Studio 2017 to build own exe.
or
download FlickerKiller.exe
ONLY TESTED ON WINDOWS 10 (all updates) and on the surface pro 4.

Delivered as is. 

Enjoy!
